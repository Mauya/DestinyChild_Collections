### Prerequisites

* Firstly sign in [GitHub](http://github.com) if you haven't already and create the project repository. 

* Secondly, download [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download). For this project you need to install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) which include latest version of npm. 

* Using npm Install: install libraries and dependencies (Package.json) install Bower.json and using bower install, install Angularjs framework, bootstrap and also this allows you to add any dependencies such as audioplayer, fontowesome etc. For more information on how to start check official website for AngularJS.

### Tech Used

- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
    - We use **AngularJS** to handle page routing, creating custom services and directives. Other Angularjs for touch-animate and audioplayer.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
    - We use **Bootstrap** to give our project a simple, responsive layout and simplify styling
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
    - We use **npm** is the basis for managing some of the dependencies in our application
- [bower](https://bower.io/)
    - **Bower** is used to manage the installation of our libraries and frameworks such as bootstrap, Jquery and Angularjs 
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) 
    - **Sublime** Text editor used for this project but you are free to choose any editor.
- [Http-server] ``` npm install -g http-server``` - This is installed to allow localhost to run the project and update saved changes. When installed run ```http-server -c-1``` to open browser to the project pages. The project will now run on [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

### Deploying the Project

* The project is deployed via the github pages (gh-pages).

### Testing

Testing is on-going using development tools in the console, but Angularjs is complex for any beginner and this becomes all important. Also the use of dependency injection makes it easy to test application code. The javaScript code in the project is checked using JSHint.
